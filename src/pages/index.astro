      <p class="description">
        I'm Joel, a TPM working on securing supercomputer infrastructure at Microsoft. This site's main goal is to host my writing and projects as I dive deep into full-stack computing. As the singularity approaches, I believe inutitive understanding of the computing systems powering AI will be a key differentiator in the short-mid term. It won't all be blog posts, I'll including personal rants and ideas too nuanced for Twitter as well. Feel free to explore & reach out!

      <h2>Explore My Work</h2>
      <p>I am learning full-stack computing, from the hardware all the way up the abstraction layers to web apps powering most of the internet today. Each component below represents a layer of the stack I am either reading, writing, or building in. As these are the early days (01/2026) there isn't much there but that will change soon.</p>
